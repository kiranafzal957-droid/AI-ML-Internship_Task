# Task 6: House Price Prediction

## Objective
Use regression models to predict housing prices based on California district features.

## Dataset
- California Housing dataset (from scikit-learn)
- Target: Median house value
- Features: Median income, house age, rooms, population, etc.

## Tools
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, pandas

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)

## Insights
- Gradient Boosting showed improved accuracy.
- Strong correlation between income and house prices observed.
